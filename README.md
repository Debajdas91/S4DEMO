[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-DEV268)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/SAP-samples/teched2020-DEV268)

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2020 session called *DEV268 - SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP Environment Connectivity and Integration.*   

## Disclaimer

> Note that this workshop was first offered in 2020; consequently, all its assets were created before the branding changes related to SAP technology were announced in January 2021. For example, SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP environment has been renamed to SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP), ABAP environment.

## Overview

In this session we will show you how you can use SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP environment for side-by-side extension scenarios with SAP S/4 HANA using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model

Our scenario is an inventory application that runs on SAP Cloud Platform, ABAP environment. This application will use product master data from an on premise S/4 HANA system that will be retrieved via calling an OData service and via calling a SOAP web service. 

To speed up the development we will use a tool called the RAP Generator that generates the complete stack of a RAP business object based on one or more tables that have to be created beforehand. 

For this workshop we even prepared a class that also creates the table for the inventory data and then calls the RAP Generator to generate the RAP business object on top. This allows us to skip writing lots of boiler plate coding that you otherwise would have to write yourself. 

And we can start much faster with the implementation of our side-by-side integration scenario, so that it fits into the schedule of a 2-hour hands-on session.
